    Lesson 1: Algorithms
       - Computers follow exactly what you write
       - An algorithm is a *sequence of steps designed to solve a particular
         problem (like a recipe)*
       - Programs can get very complex, so it is better to plan what to write 
         before you start working on your program
       - Use comments in your program so that if you or someone else looks at it
         in the future, they will understand what you wrote
       - Throughly test your program to make sure there are no bugs
       - ACTIVITY | Maze
    Lesson 2: Syntax
       - Languages have syntax so the computer can interpret your commands
       - "System.out.print()" is how you display text
       - Text has to be enclosed with quotation marks
       - "//" is how you start a comment
       - ACTIVITY | Hello World
    UNDERSTANDING TEST | Algorithms and Syntax
    Lesson 3: Variables
       - Variables are values that can change
       - Use descriptive varible names to make your program more understandable
       - Takes up computer memory (RAM), which can slow down your computer, so 
         don't make more than you need
       - Integers are declared with "int", can only be whole numbers
       - Doubles are declared with "double", can have decimals
       - Booleans are declared with "boolean", can only be either true or false
       - Characters are declared with "char", can only be characters and need to
         be enclosed in single quotations
       - Use "final" before the variable type to make it a constant
       - Assign values to your variables with "="
       - ACTIVITY | Match variables with the correct declaration
    Lesson 4: If Then Statements
       - Compare values with "==", "<=", and ">="
       - String together multiple comparisons with "||" and "&&"
       - Reverse a comparison with "!"
       - Have the computer decide what code to run based on whether a condition
         is true or false using "if" statements
       - String together multiple comparisons with "else if" and "else"
       - ACTIVITY | Make grading tool
    UNDERSTANDING TEST | Variables and If Then Statements
    Lesson 5: Loops (???)
